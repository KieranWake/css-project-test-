# mini-projects-1
Testing elements in css, practicing git commits and set-up again! 
My first three mini-projects: 
1. An animated button using box shadow and groovy hover effects!
2. A simple navbar, using cool hover styling again - this time adding a skew transition on hover! 
3. A login-card-component that practices the use of containers whilst learning the use of psuedo-classes such as :focus!
